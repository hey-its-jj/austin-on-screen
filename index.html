                    <p class="lead mb-5">This project had us puttering straight through the heart of Austin. It's kind of serendipitous how things lined up. These movies have nothing in common aside from where they were filmed. I'm excluding <em>Everybody Wants Some!!</em>, by the way. That one's in San Marcos.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <hr class="m-0" /> <!-- This thing is the page break line. -->

            <!-- Why -->
            <div class="resume-section" id="education">
                <div class="resume-section-content">
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Why?</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">The answer isn't that interesting: I chose this topic because I thought it'd be fun both to make and to learn about. Despite having lived in Austin for six years, the inner city is still new ground for me. I <em>really</em> hate driving. This idea was borne less from a desire to explore Austin and more from boredom. My other options, realistically, were as follows: a project about skating, one about the nature trail behind my house, or one about kayaking at the rowing docks. BOOO-RING. Movies it was, movies it is. Maybe the skating idea sounds interesting to you, but you ought to know that I can only do <em>one</em> trick.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">I'm also, like, kind of into movies. I'm not a buff by any means. I'm more interested in the production aspect of a movie: the writing, the shooting, the editing, yadda-yadda. I'm also not a filmmaker. I'm not an <em>anything</em>. But are you familiar with art historian Walter Benjamin? Do you know the "aura"? In basic terms, it's the "you had to be there" feeling. Seeing a filming location right there in front of me is a cooler experience than I was expecting. Pulling up to the "Initech" building--it was the first location we covered--took me by surprise, genuinely, and I am NOT an emotive person. Being at a "set" engenders a different kind of appreciation for a movie. I guess seeing the location kind of puts the production into perspective--like it makes the effort that went into a film more tangible.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">I think what defines a "nerd" is the proclivity to experience excitement only in regards to things nobody actually cares about. And using big words. So one more thing that doing this project taught me is that I am 100% a nerd, and not the charming kind.</p>
