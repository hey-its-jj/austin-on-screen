                    <p class="lead mb-5">Peter Gibbons, white-collar schmuck, undergoes occupational hypnotherapy in an attempt to assuage the existential dread inherent to his soul-sucking nine-to-five. To Peter&rsquo;s surprise, it works, awakening within him what could easily be the latent ghost of a hedonist stoner. Peter&rsquo;s new lackadaisical philosophy, as well as an increasingly turgid docket of workplace injustices, works to turn the corporate pecking order topsy-turvy. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space" target="_blank"><em>Office Space</em></a> was directed by Mike Judge, creator of <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead&nbsp;</em>and <em>King of the Hill</em>. It didn&rsquo;t do great at the box office, but it&rsquo;s certainly garnered its own cult appreciation, and it stands as an eerily accurate satire of cubical culture even twenty-plus years later. I can say that because I worked a job <em>just&nbsp;</em>like Peter&rsquo;s for two years, and I&rsquo;ve been depressed ever since.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">I was <em>stoked</em> to find out that <em>Office Space</em> was filmed in Austin. I was nervous about the locations for this one because I thought some businessowner would come out yelling at us to leave. I spent the nights following our outing agonizing over contigency plans and alibis, but it turns out we got the footage we needed without any issues.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">IN THREE WORDS...</h2>
                    <h3 class="mb-0 centertext videoheader"> This movie is <span class="text-primary">clever, fun,</span> and <span class="text-primary"> simple</span></h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5"><em>Office Space&nbsp;</em>is short, funny, endlessly quotable and, above all, still relevant. I feel like every comedy ever has been described in exactly that way, but I&rsquo;m creatively bankrupt, so just take my word for it. Mike Judge tends to demonstrate a very personal understanding of the people and situations he writes about. The characters themselves are a little one-note, but the dialogue is really where the fun is at. Peter&rsquo;s romance with Joanna feels a bit shallow, but this isn&rsquo;t a romcom. The soundtrack goes crazy; a good handful of nostalgic g-hop tracks to complement the absurd dichotomy between g-shit and office culture. There&rsquo;s no caveat there. I know I kind of set it up like there would be, but the soundtrack is just cool.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Anyway, <em>Office Space&nbsp;</em>isn&rsquo;t going to blow your mind, but you know what? It doesn&rsquo;t have to. I appreciate a movie that you can watch on a whim, without thinking about whether you have the time or are in the mood. That&rsquo;s not to say that this film is superficial; it has something to say, but it&rsquo;s still light and fun. Digestible, I guess.</p>
