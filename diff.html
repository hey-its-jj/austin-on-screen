                    <p class="lead mb-5">Overall, this project went pretty smoothly. Even parking wasn&rsquo;t as big of a headache as I thought it would be, although that&rsquo;s not saying much considering it&rsquo;s Austin. It was a headache, but it wasn&rsquo;t a <em>migraine</em>. But all of that frantic, paranoid planning paid off: We visited all the locations on the list in a relatively short time and without dying. Before filming, I had this idea that we&rsquo;d inevitably get tackled by some tweaked-out, angry businessowner, or like a random extant cryptid.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Still, there are a few things I&rsquo;d do differently if I were to do this over. First off: the camera. The &ldquo;ancient camcorder&rdquo; aesthetic isn&rsquo;t as charming as I&rsquo;d imagined it would be. It&rsquo;s less of an aesthetic and more of a hideous impediment. You can hardly make out my face as I&rsquo;m talking; it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m broadcasting from Olympus Mons. Initially, I opted for the camcorder because I didn&rsquo;t want to worry about storage space. Using my phone would necessitate lugging my expensive laptop around so I could transfer the video files over and make room for more footage. I <em>guess&nbsp;</em>I could&rsquo;ve used the cloud, but uploading giant, uncut video files over spotty 4G probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gone that well. If I were to make a habit of content creation, then I&rsquo;d absolutely invest in a functional video camera. I didn&rsquo;t <em>go out&nbsp;</em>and find this camcorder specifically for this project, by the by; it&rsquo;s just a camcorder we&rsquo;ve had lying around for ten-odd years.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Then there&rsquo;s the audio quality. I might as well have invested in a lapel mic or something. I doubt they&rsquo;re very expensive. I ended up using a free voice recording app and holding my phone up to my mouth, and while it definitely helped with the background noise, the clarity is sub-par. While we&rsquo;re on the subject&mdash;my line delivery. It&rsquo;s awful. I&rsquo;m not used to being on camera and talk <em>way&nbsp;</em>too fast. I know <em>everyone&nbsp;</em>says you&rsquo;re supposed to hate your own voice when you hear it played back to you, but I&rsquo;m convinced that my voice and cadence are objectively infuriating. I want to give myself a swirlie every time I see myself on screen. I will <em>never&nbsp;</em>clone myself because it would invariably end with a deathmatch a la <em>Highlander</em>. It would <em>begin&nbsp;</em>with a deathmatch, actually.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Finally, now that I know what a project like this demands of me, I can say that I should&rsquo;ve covered more filming locations. It was a good idea, I think, to keep it condensed for the first try, but there are <em>so&nbsp;</em>many locations in Austin that I wish I could&rsquo;ve visited. Part of the reason for the scant approach is that I didn&rsquo;t want to inconvenience my brother. If it were only me, I probably would&rsquo;ve gone for more, and over multiple days. Still, having a filming partner made things WAY easier, and frankly, it made us look less conspicuous. Sadly, being mixed, I kind of have to think about how I look while I&rsquo;m ambling around doing literally nothing.</p>
